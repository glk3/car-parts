# Car Parts Sale
This smal project is designed to manage and track the sales, ordered stock, and returns of car parts (oil, oil filter, and tyres) using Google Sheets for data storage. The application allows users to input sales data, calculate returns, and automatically update stock levels based on recent sales trends.
